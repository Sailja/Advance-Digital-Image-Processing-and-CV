Q1&2. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q1,2.py
    This will read both the images and convert the color image to gray.
    Image1 and Image2 will be displayed. Close these window and then gray scale image will be displayed. 
Q3. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q3Noise.py 
    Then enter the value of p.
    Salt Pepper noise will be added. Close the window and median filtered denoised images will be dispayed. Close this window and wait     for the denoised image  using mean filter to be displayed.
Q4. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q4PSNR.py
    A PSNR vs p plot will be displayed where the red line is for median filter and green line is for mean filter.
Q5. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q5Sobel.py
Q6. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q6DCT_IDCT.py
    It will take more computation time(5-10 mints)
Q7. Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python Q7Harris.py 

Q8(Bonus). Type the following command in terminal to compile
	python UsingLib.py
    This will illustrate Q1,2,3 using openCV library
            python Sobel_Lib.py
	    python dct_idct_lib.py
            python Harris_Lib.py

We observe that using library it takes less computation time and also better results.
